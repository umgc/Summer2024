# TestWizard

TestWizard aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate unique assessments and keys for middle and high school students, ensuring high-quality education and reducing cheating.

## Local Development

You can run the application from any of your configured devices, browsers, or emulators using the following command and follwing the prompts:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

You can run the application with a defined environment variables file using this command:

```bash
$ flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env #looks for a .env file in the root directory of test_wizard
```

## Testing

Test all tests in the `test` directory with:

```bash
$ flutter test
```
